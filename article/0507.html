<p>Recent market performance has shown a calm upward trend, with the S&P/ASX 200 index closing up by 26.7 points, a gain of 0.35%. Despite no major adverse events in the past 24 hours, the stock market continues to exhibit moderate growth. However, seasoned analyst Thomas McGee points out that although the overall market is rising, the number of declining stocks actually exceeds the number of rising stocks, which is not a typical sign of a healthy market.</p>

<h2>Analysis of Stock and Precious Metals Performance</h2>
<p>In the current trading, despite poor retail sales data, the real estate and discretionary consumer stocks still showed strong performance. Thomas McGee believes that this reflects a positive response from the market to the decline in interest rates. When market interest rates fall, borrowing costs decrease, leading to increased consumer and investment activities, thus supporting the stock prices in these sectors. Thomas McGee notes that although these stocks may benefit from lower interest rates in the short term, investors need to closely monitor long-term market trends and other economic indicators to avoid potential risks posed by market fluctuations.</p>

<p>In the commodities market, gold and silver prices are retracing to their respective key support levels. The current pullback in gold and silver prices provides an important perspective to observe market sentiment and economic expectations. Thomas McGee advises investors to pay attention to the performance of these key support levels to assess market risk preferences and future trends.</p>

<h2>Impact of Global Economic Trends on the Australian Stock Market</h2>
<p>Despite the decline in the market interest rates of Australia, changes in interest rate policies in major global economies, especially the policy direction of the Federal Reserve System in the United States, have profound implications for the Australian market. The strong performance of the U.S. economy may prompt the Federal Reserve to maintain or raise interest rate levels, increasing uncertainty in global capital flows, thus affecting the cost of funds and investment climate of Australia. Thomas McGee reminds investors that changes in the global interest rate environment need to be closely monitored as they directly relate to returns and risks of cross-border investments.</p>

<p>The current instability in global trade, such as trade wars and tariff issues, may affect the export performance of Australia, thereby influencing the stock market performance of related industries.</p>

<h2>Strategic Vision and Investment Allocation</h2>
<p>Thomas McGee concludes by pointing out that in the face of global economic and market uncertainties, investors need to adopt a more strategic perspective and approach. By understanding the impact of global economic trends on the local market, investors can make better investment decisions, seeking growth opportunities while protecting capital.</p>
