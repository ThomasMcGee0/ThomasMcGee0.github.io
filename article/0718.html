<p>Thomas McGee points out that despite signs of global economic slowdown, the ASX 200 has shown unusually strong performance. Recent data shows ASX 200 futures trading up 73 points, a growth of 0.94%, primarily benefiting from the robust fundamentals and positive international market sentiment of Australia.
